        Our positive mission is to combat the roots of societal issues by
        addressing illiteracy, which is often considered the creator of all
        evils. We are dedicated to achieving this goal by imparting
        qualitative, logical, and value-based modern education. Our vision
        aligns with nurturing liberal rational humanism, empathy, and
        togetherness in the new generations, fostering a community that
        values education and understands the importance of shared humanity
        for an honest prosperity of both mind and matter.
